# Hull_Design

  Design a Hull shape based on using Beziers Curves by using basics parameters  - VBA - Excel 2003

  Need on imput values : 
    - Total lenght if the hull
    - Maximal Width
    - Width at the back of the hull
    - Depth of the hull according see level
    - Height of the hull according see level.

# Usage

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

On main sheet, define parameters of your hull.
Then specifie on functions F1, H1, poupe & proue positions of the Beziers knots.

Check below if the geometry of beziers curves satisfies your need.

Then launch a calculation, by cliquing on "Calculer", the program compute the volume of your hull and export :
- on somes graphes the shape.

- A table with values of geometrical and mecanical characteristics of the hull, of graphes (for example, A

-others parameters of the boat can be configured as the position of sails, mast, keel and rudder.

This software allowed me to be able to build a small scaled sailing boat (1m long, in 2004).
